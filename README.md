--- Challenge currently in progress ---

# Part 1: PyBank

## Objective

In this Challenge, you are tasked with creating a Python script to analyze the financial records of your company.
You will be given a financial dataset called budget_data.csv. The dataset is composed of two columns: "Date" and
"Profit/Losses".

Your task is to create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following values:
* The total number of months included in the dataset
* The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
* The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes
* The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
* The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.

Your analysis should align with the following results:

In addition, the final script should both print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results.

## Data and script files
* [Link](https://github.com/brenprie/Python-Challenge/blob/main/PyBank/Resources/budget_data.csv) to csv data file in /PyBank/Resources this repo. 
* Link to script file on this repo.

## Output
* [Link](https://github.com/brenprie/Python-Challenge/blob/main/PyBank/Analysis/budget_analysis.txt) to output text file in /PyBank/analysis on this repo.

# Part 2: PyPoll

## Objective

In this Challenge, you are tasked with helping a small, rural town modernize its vote-counting process. You will be 
given a set of poll data called election_data.csv. The dataset is composed of three columns: "Voter ID", "County", 
and "Candidate". 

Your task is to create a Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following values:
* The total number of votes cast
* A complete list of candidates who received votes
* The percentage of votes each candidate won
* The total number of votes each candidate won
* The winner of the election based on popular vote.

Your analysis should align with the following results:
